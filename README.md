# alice-qa-clf
Repository for my ALICE service task: "Classification of TPC QA Run2 data based on ML techniques".

Its aim is to automate (at least partially) process of assessing quality of data collected by ALICE experiment. 

It gathers all information about my service task: 
starting from notes taken when I learn new thing related to it, 
through simple analyses and ending up with developed solution of my task.

For CERN/ALICE users see also associated JIRA ticket: https://alice.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ADQT-3
